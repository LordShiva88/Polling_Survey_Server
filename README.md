# Polling Survey Backend

## Challenges Faced

During the development of the Polling Survey Backend, we encountered and overcame several challenges to ensure a robust and fully functional application.

### 1. MongoDB Connection and Configuration

Setting up a secure and efficient connection to MongoDB demanded meticulous configuration of connection strings, managing database credentials, and addressing potential connection issues.

### 2. User Authentication and Authorization

Implementing a secure user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and ensuring proper authorization for various user roles, including admin privileges, presented challenges in terms of validation and security.

### 3. Integration with Stripe for Payments

Integrating the Stripe payment gateway involved comprehending the API, managing client and server-side interactions, and ensuring the overall security of payment transactions.

### 4. Error Handling and Validation

Effective error management and the implementation of robust validation mechanisms throughout the codebase were vital for providing meaningful feedback to users and maintaining the overall integrity of the application.

### 5. Deployment and Environment Setup

Deploying the application to a production environment required thoughtful consideration of environment variables, secure configuration management, and addressing potential deployment-related issues.
